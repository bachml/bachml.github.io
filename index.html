Guohang Zeng
I am a PhD Candidate at Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute, University Technology Sydney, advised by Jie Lu. Before that, I graduated from The University of Melbourne with a M.Phil degree, advised by James Bailey, and obtained a B.Eng degree from Shenzhen University.

I have also spent wonderful time at Huawei and SenseTime. I previously worked as a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on computer vision and facial recognition.

Currently, I'm interested in recommendation systems, representation learning and generative models.

I am expected to graduate in early 2026 and open to industry opportunities. You can reach me at ghzeng2.718@gmail.com, and my resume is here. My google scholar can be found here.
